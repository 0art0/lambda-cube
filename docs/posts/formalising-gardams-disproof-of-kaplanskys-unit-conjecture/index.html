A complete formal proof of Gardam&#39;s disproof would involve two broad components:</p>

<li>A proof that the group $P$ is torsion-free</li>

Siddhartha Gadgil and I recently <a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/unit_conjecture/GardamTheorem.html">formalised</a> this result in <code class="verbatim">Lean4</code>, the latest release of the Lean theorem prover that is designed from the ground up as both a programming language as well as a theorem prover.</p>
<p>
A detailed account of the formalisation is available on <a href="https://siddhartha-gadgil.github.io/automating-mathematics/posts/formalizing-gardam-disproof-kaplansky-conjecture/.">Siddhartha Gadgil&#39;s blog</a>. This post will explore some of the design choices we made in our formalisation.</p>

The group $P$
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Central to Gardam&#39;s counter-example is the group $P$, a virtually Abelian group with the presentation $\langle a, b \vert a^{-1}b^{2}a = b^{-2}, b^{-1}a^{2}b = a^{-2}\rangle$. Earlier work by Promislow shows that $P$ is an example of a torsion-free group that <em>does not</em> satisfy the unique-product property, a purely combinatorial property of a group that is known to imply the unit conjecture for any group ring over that group.</p>
<p>
The two components of the proof mentioned above deal with different aspects of the group $P$:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first is a mathematical proof, which requires a detailed analysis of the <em>structure</em> of $P$</li>
<li>the second is a computation, which depends on <em>algorithmic properties</em> of $P$, such as being able to efficiently decide when two elements are equal</li>
</ul>
<p>The group $P$ admits several descriptions - algebraic, topological, as well as combinatorial. Given our dual requirements of computing and proving, the description of $P$ that was most suitable was as a <em>Metabelian group</em>.</p>
