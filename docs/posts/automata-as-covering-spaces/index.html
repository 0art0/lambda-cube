A quick search of the internet does not bring up anything related, but it is possible that this connection has already been made before. This article is written to be self-contained in the relevant concepts and terminology.\nMonoids Definition A monoid is an algebraic structure that can be regarded as a group without inverses. More concretely, a monoid is a set (or a type) equipped with an associative binary operation and a two-sided identity.\nFamiliar examples of monoids are the natural numbers (including zero) under addition, and strings over a fixed alphabet, such as the lower case English alphabet, under concatenation.\nMonoid homomorphisms A monoid homomorphism is a map between monoids that preserves the identity and composition.\nFree monoids The free monoid on a set consists of all (finite) strings involving elements of the set; the empty string is the identity element and the associative monoid operation is concatenation.\nThe free monoid $\\Sigma^{*}$ on a set $\\Sigma$ can also be characterised by a universal property: Any set-theoretic function from $\\Sigma$ to a monoid $M$ extends uniquely to a monoid homomorphism from $\\Sigma^{*}$ to $M$.\nGraphs A graph here is taken to mean a directed multi-graph, sometimes also known as a quiver.\nDefinition A graph or quiver is defined to be a set of \"vertices\" (or \"objects\") where each ordered pair of vertices is equipped with a set of \"edges\" (or \"arrows\" or \"morphisms\").\nPaths A path of a graph is defined to be a finite sequence of linked edges (edges such that the target of the first is the source of the next).\nLoops A loop is a path in which the first and last vertex coincide.\nThe fundamental monoid The set of loops based at a point on a graph can be endowed with the structure of a monoid. Loops at a point can be composed to get longer loops, and the trivial loop of length zero serves as the identity. This monoid is called the fundamental monoid of the graph at the given vertex.\nGraph homomorphisms A homomorphism between graphs is a pair of maps, one mapping vertices to vertices, and the other mapping edges between any given pair of vertices in the source to edges between the corresponding pair of vertices in the target.\nBouquet of circles A bouquet of circles is defined as a graph consisting of a single vertex. The circles in the bouquet comprise the edges from the single vertex to itself, and the fundamental monoid of such a graph at the only vertex is isomorphic to the free monoid on the set of circles.\nNeighbourhoods The neighbourhood of a vertex of a graph is defined to be the set of edges of the graph originating at that vertex.\nCovering spaces of graphs Definition A covering of a graph $G$ is a graph $C$ together with a surjective graph homomorphism $\\phi : C \\to G$ which is a local isomorphism - that is, the neighbourhood of any vertex in the covering graph is mapped isomorphically by $\\phi$ to the neighbourhood of its image. Such a map is known as a covering map.\nIt follows from the local isomorphism condition that for any vertex $v$ in the cover and edge $e : \\phi(v) \\to w$ in the base, there is a unique edge in the cover originating at $v$ and mapping to $e$ via $\\phi$. This edge in the cover is called the lift of $e$ at the vertex $v$.\nPath lifting Edge lifting can be performed iteratively to lift entire paths in the base originating at $\\phi(v)$ uniquely to paths in the cover originating at $v$. A full description of path lifting is given by induction on the size of the path - the trivial path at $\\phi(v)$ lifts uniquely to the trivial path at $v$, and for a path starting with an edge $e$ can be lifted by first lifting the edge $e$ and then lifting the remaining path from the next vertex.\nAutomata Definition A deterministic automaton consists of\nA finite set of states $Q$ An alphabet $\\Sigma$ A transition function $\\delta : Q \\times \\Sigma \\to Q$ An initial state $q_{0} \\in Q$ A set of accept states $F \\subseteq Q$ Let $w$ be a string over the alphabet $\\Sigma$. If $w$ starts with the letter $a$, the automaton moves from its initial state $q_{0}$ to the state $\\delta(q_{0}, a)$ determined by the transition function. The rest of the string is then processed in a similar way, but now with the updated state. The automaton halts when it has reached the end of the string. If the state at the time of halting is among the accept states, then $w$ is considered to be recognised by the automaton. Otherwise, the string $w$ is considered rejected by the automaton.\nState diagrams Every automaton can be depicted visually by a state diagram, which is a labelled directed graph whose vertices are the states and whose edges represent transitions between states (see the image below).\nThe state diagram of a two state automaton\nAutomata as covering spaces of graphs Every automaton with alphabet $\\Sigma$ can be considered as a covering space of the bouquet whose set of circles is $\\Sigma$. The graphs corresponding to the automaton is its state diagram. The covering map sends all vertices of the automaton to the single vertex of the bouquet of circles, and an edge representing a transition due to a letter $a$ to the circle in the bouquet representing $a$. The local isomorphism condition is satisfied since there is exactly one transition out of any given state for each letter $a$ in the alphabet $\\Sigma$.\nA path in the bouquet of circles represents a unique word over the alphabet $\\Sigma$. The automaton executes a word by starting at the initial state and updating the state according to the next letter in the word, precisely the way in which path lifting is performed starting at the vertex representing the initial state. The word is accepted by the automaton if and only if the other endpoint of the lift is contained in the set of vertices representing accept states.\nConclusion The interpretation described above connects two mathematical objects from areas that appear to have very little to do with each other - automata from theoretical computer science and covering spaces from algebraic topology. Generalisations of this connection are suggested by both the topological as well as computational sides. From the topological side, it would be interesting to understand this connection in terms of arbitrary CW complexes, not just graphs, with higher lifting (such as homotopy lifting) in addition to path lifting. From the side of theoretical computer science, finding similar topological interpretations of other models of computation - such as push-down automata or Turing machines - is an interesting (and possibly open) question.\nFurther details about covering spaces of graphs and automata will appear in subsequent blog posts on Topological methods in group theory and the Myhill-Nerode theorem respectively.\n",

<p>
A <em>covering</em> of a graph $G$ is a graph $C$ together with a surjective graph homomorphism $\phi : C \to G$ which is a local isomorphism - that is, the neighbourhood of any vertex in the covering graph is mapped isomorphically by $\phi$ to the neighbourhood of its image. Such a map is known as a <em>covering map</em>.</p>
<p>
It follows from the local isomorphism condition that for any vertex $v$ in the cover and edge $e : \phi(v) \to w$ in the base, there is a unique edge in the cover originating at $v$ and mapping to $e$ via $\phi$. This edge in the cover is called the <em>lift</em> of $e$ at the vertex $v$.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Edge lifting can be performed iteratively to lift entire paths in the base originating at $\phi(v)$ uniquely to paths in the cover originating at $v$. A full description of path lifting is given by induction on the size of the path - the trivial path at $\phi(v)$ lifts uniquely to the trivial path at $v$, and for a path starting with an edge $e$ can be lifted by first lifting the edge $e$ and then lifting the remaining path from the next vertex.</p>

Definition
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
A deterministic automaton consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>A finite set of states $Q$</li>
<li>An alphabet $\Sigma$</li>
<li>A transition function $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \to Q$</li>
<li>An initial state $q_{0} \in Q$</li>
<li>A set of accept states $F \subseteq Q$</li>
</ul>
<p>Let $w$ be a string over the alphabet $\Sigma$. If $w$ starts with the letter $a$, the automaton moves from its initial state $q_{0}$ to the state $\delta(q_{0}, a)$ determined by the transition function. The rest of the string is then processed in a similar way, but now with the updated state. The automaton halts when it has reached the end of the string. If the state at the time of halting is among the accept states, then $w$ is considered to be <em>recognised</em> by the automaton. Otherwise, the string $w$ is considered <em>rejected</em> by the automaton.</p>

State diagrams

<p>
Every automaton can be depicted visually by a <em>state diagram</em>, which is a labelled directed graph whose vertices are the states and whose edges   represent transitions between states (see the image below).</p>

Automata as covering spaces of graphs
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Every automaton with alphabet $\Sigma$ can be considered as a covering space of the bouquet whose set of circles is $\Sigma$. The graphs corresponding to the automaton is its state diagram. The covering map sends all vertices of the automaton to the single vertex of the bouquet of circles, and an edge representing a transition due to a letter $a$ to the circle in the bouquet representing $a$. The local isomorphism condition is satisfied since there is exactly one transition out of any given state for each letter $a$ in the alphabet $\Sigma$.</p>
<p>
A path in the bouquet of circles represents a unique word over the alphabet $\Sigma$. The automaton executes a word by starting at the initial state and updating the state according to the next letter in the word, precisely the way in which path lifting is performed starting at the vertex representing the initial state. The word is accepted by the automaton if and only if the other endpoint of the lift is contained in the set of vertices representing accept states.</p>

Conclusion
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The interpretation described above connects two mathematical objects from areas that appear to have very little to do with each other - automata from theoretical computer science and covering spaces from algebraic topology. Generalisations of this connection are suggested by both the topological as well as computational sides. From the topological side, it would be interesting to understand this connection in terms of arbitrary CW complexes, not just graphs, with higher lifting (such as homotopy lifting) in addition to path lifting. From the side of theoretical computer science, finding similar topological interpretations of other models of computation - such as push-down automata or Turing machines - is an interesting (and possibly open) question.</p>
<p>
Further details about covering spaces of graphs and automata will appear in subsequent blog posts on <em>Topological methods in group theory</em> and <em>the Myhill-Nerode theorem</em> respectively.</p>
